                 65 66 67 68 69 70

abstraction - a layering of simple ideas on top of one another to build more complex models

algorithm - step by step instructions for solving a problem
  e.g. finding a name in a phone book
  page by page = n
  start in middle split in half every time not found = n/2

pseudocode - writing out steps of code in a human readable manner

boolean - a question with a true or false answer - allows for logic
