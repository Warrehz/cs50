a location or address is given the word pointer
pointer can be thought of as a location in memory
    e.g. have string s = "mical"
         s is a variable that points to location of "mical" in memory

string in C is really just a synonym for char *
    e.g. string s = "mical", char *s = "mical"
         * is the symbol given to represent pointer, char indicates the data type pointed to

malloc - stands for memory allocation, a function that takes one argument and reserves that number of bytes
    e.g. char *name = malloc(10);
        reserves 10 back to back chunks of memory and returns the address of the first slot

* - multiplication
    e.g. 4 * 4;
char *variable - declaring a variable
    e.g. char *name = "mical";
*(s + i) - go to address

& - will get the address of a variable
    e.g. &name - gets address of variable name
